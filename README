******************** DESCRIPTION ******************

DTF (Data Transfer Framework) is a general I/O arbitration middleware
designed for multi-component applications that use file-base component
coupling. DTF works for applications that use the Parallel netCDF 
(PnetCDF) library for file I/O. It allows the user to transparently 
replace file I/O with sending the data directly between the components.

There is no need to modify the original PnetCDF calls, however, the user 
needs to add a few DTF API calls to the source code of each of the 
coupled components as well as provide a simple configuration file to the DTF.
  
Additionally, DTF only works with the modified version of PnetCDF-1.7.0
 that is provided as part of this distribution.
