******************** DESCRIPTION ******************

DTF (Data Transfer Framework) is a general I/O arbitration middleware
designed for multi-component applications that use file-base component
coupling. DTF works for applications that use the Parallel netCDF 
(PnetCDF) library for file I/O. It allows the user to transparently 
replace file I/O with sending the data directly between the components.

******************** NOTES ******************
- There is no need to modify the original PnetCDF calls, however, the user 
  needs to add a few DTF API calls to the source code of each of the 
  coupled components as well as provide a simple configuration file to the DTF.
  
- Additionally, DTF only works with the modified version of PnetCDF-1.7.0
  that is provided as part of this distribution. 
 
- DTF relies on MPI to transfer the data, therefore, all the coupled components
  must run simultaneously.
 
Please see doc/ for more information on how to use the framework.
