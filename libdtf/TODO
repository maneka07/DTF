* figure out how to handle when the data in the file is overwritten (discard old I/O reqs)

-> on the writer's side -> discard old I/O request
-> if master detects overlap from different processes, throw a warning "State of the file undefined" but continue executing. 

* after a discussion with Wei-keng: 

2) replace packing of data with derived datatypes - will avoid memcopy

* for scalar var no need to do request matching? Everyone should have the data?


commit notes (27.07)

- added code for transfering scalar vars;
- bugfix in using ncids, added dtf_set_ncid() API, removed any communication of ncid between components since ncid is a process-local var, not file var;
