* figure out how to handle when the data in the file is overwritten (discard old I/O reqs)

-> on the writer's side -> discard old I/O request
-> if master detects overlap from different processes, throw a warning "State of the file undefined" but continue executing. 

* dealing with multiple master processes

* after a discussion with Wei-keng: 

1) instead of using master nodes send I/O requests to all writers?
2) replace packing of data with derived datatypes - will avoid memcopy

* for scalar var no need to do request matching? Everyone should have the data?
